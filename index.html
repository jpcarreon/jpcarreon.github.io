					<h3>Favorite CMSC Subject</h3>
					<p>
					So far, my favourite Computer Science subject has to be CMSC 150. I really enjoyed coding in R,
					it was very simple and it really felt like solving a puzzle. One of the things that really stuck
					with me was using <em>paste</em> multiple times to create a function. It was pretty cool
					to see the resulting string and making sure the function works correctly. That said, it wasn't
					all fun, the Mathematical discussions were sometimes difficult to understand. Thankfully,
					there was at least two examples for the procedures in each topic.

					<h3>Favorite GE</h3>
					<p>
					My favorite GE is Ethics. I got Sir Paul Lusanta as my professor in that subject and his discussions
					were pretty fun. Though there was a lot of group activities, the activities themselves were very
					amusing. I'll never forget the time where I had to be blindfolded and follow instructions that my
					groupmates told me. That activity was very chaotic considering there were about six groups and
					two members in each group had to be blindfolded. It was kind of a miracle that I was able to hear
					my groupmates through the chaos since there was a lot of people shouting. For me, that is one of
					my most memorable experiences so far.

					<h3>Favorite Programming Language</h3>
					<p>
					Thinking about this, I didn't have a great experience with C, so my favorite progamming language has to be
					Python. What is great about Python is how readable the code is and the syntax is very simple. Back in
					2019, I even used Python to clear some challenges in an online event that is held every December, Advent
					of Code. Though, I couldn't make it too far, I experiences not much trouble using Python for that. However,
					there is one thing I would like to change about it: <em>elif</em>. <em>Elif</em> is very different to other
					programming languages and I prefer to just conjuct <em>else</em> and <em>if</em>.
